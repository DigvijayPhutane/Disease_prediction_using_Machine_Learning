# Disease_prediction_using_Machine_Learning
Disease Prediction using Machine Learning: Utilizing decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting classifiers to develop an accurate and comprehensive model for diagnosing medical conditions based on patient data.
### Overview

This project focuses on developing a robust and accurate disease prediction system using machine learning techniques, specifically employing decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting classifiers. The primary goal of this project is to assist in the early diagnosis and prediction of medical conditions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

### Features

- Utilizes decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting classifiers to analyze patient data.
- Predicts a wide range of medical conditions based on various factors and symptoms.
- Provides insights and recommendations for medical practitioners to aid in diagnosis.
- Supports both binary classification (e.g., disease present/absent) and multiclass classification (e.g., multiple disease categories).
- Customizable and extendable for different medical domains and data sources.

### Key Components

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data collection, cleaning, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for model training.

- **Classifier Models**: Utilizes decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting classifiers for prediction and analysis.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Employs appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess model performance.

### Requirements

- Python 3.11
- Machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE
- DATA SET - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning?select=Training.csv
### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries and dependencies.
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for training and using the disease prediction models.
4. Input patient data for predictions or analysis.

### Future Enhancements

- Integration with healthcare systems and electronic health records (EHR) for real-time patient data retrieval.
- Improved feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques for model optimization.
- Development of a user-friendly web or mobile application for healthcare professionals.
